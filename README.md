# Work-Day-Planner

When I am using a daily planner to create a schedule,
Then I open the planner.
Then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar,
Then I can scroll down,
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours,
Then I view the timeblocks for that day,
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future,
Then I click into a timeblock,
Then I can enter an event,
Then I click the save button for that timeblock,
Then the text for that event is saved in local storage,
Then I refresh the page,
Then the saved events persist.
